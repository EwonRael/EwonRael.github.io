Like, it's got to be one of the least chill places in Hogwarts (and I am including the forbidden forrest and that tree that tries to eat cars)<br><br>like first of all (and I know this has been pointed out before) like 80% of Slytherins are literal nazis. That does not vibe with me dude. That's like actually what Slytherins' personality trait is. WTF? You cant just have one out of the four houses be literal wizard nazis that's like way too many nazis. Something is seriously screwed with the Hogwarts admissions process if 1/6th of the student body are terrorizing anybody with muggle blood. It's not like they have to admit everybody?? Even if they did you'd think they could spread them out so they're not all in one place. Visiting the Slytherin dorm makes me worried I'm going to be harassed or actually murdered (which, by the way, you could 100% get away with, with all the medusa snakes roaming around and moving staircases you could easily fall off of)<br><br>Second of all, why is the Slytherin dorm in the basement? It's always cold and damp and the windows are those fake kind where they use magic to make it seem like you aren't underground (not convincing!) but you can tell you are because it's weirdly breezy for air that's stale hanging out in a basement is like fun and cool if it's a sex dungeon or one of those themed restaurants where the waiters have to sing for you, but as a permanent living quarters it gets really boring + you have to go up like 8 flights of stairs just to get to ground level so you're always out of breath for any class that isn't potions. The fact they won't install an elevator is ableist as hell I don't care that it's a hIsToRiCaL bUiLdInG they don't seem to mind making renovations to accommodate a lifesized chess set on the third floor (which, by the way, is &quot;forbidden&quot; only because the faculty care more about having exclusive use of the giant chess set then anything to do with student safety) not cool guys.<br><br>Finally, I swear to god, every time I'm hanging out in the Slytherin dorms they're vacuuming you'd think they could use magic or something but there's always some elf (#spew) vacuuming the commons it's so loud and distracting and I'm always worried he's mad at me for getting the carpet dirty when he just vacuumed that spot + I'm always stressed out that he hasn't vacuumed the area I'm hanging out in and he isn't going to if I'm there because he doesn't want to bother me so I'll try and move to a different area but I don't want him to think I'm moving for his sake so I'll try and time it like I'm moving for unrelated reasons but then I'm worried he really has vacuumed the spot I'm in already and I'll look like an inconsiderate jerk needlessly dirtying another spot and I get so overwhelmed I always end up leaving the commons #studentlife",
