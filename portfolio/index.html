    <h2>Introduction:</h2>
    <p>Hi There! </p>
    <p>There is a lot of work that I am including in my portfolio. Much of it is stuff that takes some time to appreciate: it is contemplative, or lengthy. Time is always a limited resource, and I would rather have a small selection of my work be given more of it, then a lot of my work be given little.</p>
    <p>For this reason, I just want to start off by highlighting a couple things that I think are most representative of the artist I am at this moment in time. If time constraints mean that some work has to be prioritized, this is the work I'd prefer.</p>

    <h2 class="overpic" id="Activities">Activities Index</h2>
    <p>In his 1969 Essay <i>The Activity: A New Form of Art,</i> Michael Kirby proposes a new art classification which he dubs the "Activity." Activities are a set of directions for the audience to follow, and the art exists in the performance of the directions. </p><p> I like this idea of Activity. Activities radically resist commodification, and redirect attention to the audience and away from the artist, both of which are important counterpoints to our expensive art world that celebrates individual artistic genuineness. </p><p><i>Activities Index</i> is a collection of work that I think adheres to this idea of Activity.  Michael Kirby was responding mainly to the Fluxus movement of the 60s, but this collection goes back as far as 1922 and includes work as recant as 2018. It includes work by composers, religious philosophers, painters, and friends of mine. Hopefully it encourages you to rethink art, and maybe even perform some Activities yourself!<br><a href="https://activities-index.github.io/" target="_blank">View Site&#x2192;</a></p>

    <div style="background-image: url('resource/CowboyCollective.png');" class="images"></div>
    <h2 class="overpic" id="cc">The Cowboy Collective</h2>
    <p><i>The Cowboy Collective</i> is a space to celebrate and create cowboy themed art and media. The work can be fun, thoughtful, ironic, sentimental, irreverent, academic, sometimes all these things at once. The site includes essays about <a href="https://cowboycollective.cc/cowboy/Mary%20Poppins" target="_blank">why Marry Poppins is a cowboy</a>, or <a href="https://cowboycollective.cc/2020/09/05/CowboyEssay.html" target="_blank">examining the changing image and memory of the cowboy</a>. It includes an <a href="https://cowboycollective.cc/2021/02/20/Pistol-Pete.html" target="_blank">unaired television pilot</a>, a <a href="https://cowboycollective.cc/2020/10/16/CaterpillarCowboy.html" target="_blank">caterpillar themed video game</a>, a <a href="https://cowboycollective.cc/2020/04/13/AILit.html" target="_blank">crude AI that generate cowboy literature</a>, and the <a href="https://cowboycollective.cc/2020/09/25/CowChildren.html" target="_blank">surreal, nightmarish podcast Cow Children</a>. The site encourages you to make by providing resources like <a href="https://cowboycollective.cc/2019/11/30/CowboyFonts.html" target="_blank">fonts</a>, <a href="https://cowboycollective.cc/2019/12/01/WANTEDPosters.html" target="_blank">wanted poster templates</a>, a <a href="https://cowboycollective.cc/2019/12/03/03CowboyhatPack.html" target="_blank">pre-photoshopped cowboy hat pack</a>, and most importantly, a <a href="https://cowboycollective.cc/music" target="_blank">$1000 (yes real money) reward for making a minute-long music video</a>.</p><p>The collective is colorful, eclectic, weird, and engaging, and you would be forgiven for missing the underlying political aims of the site. But the Cowboy Collective has a goal: <a href="https://cowboycollective.cc/2019/11/28/Manifesto.html" target="_blank">saving American masculinity.</a></p><p>I'm an American boy, and growing up in a country where almost two mass shootings occur a day (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mass_shootings_in_the_United_States_in_2020" target="_blank">even during a pandemic</a>) is scary and alienating. I never felt connected to my country's culture, especially what it has to say about being a man, and while living there I started to detest my own identity. I wished to amputate the American man in me and throw it away.</p><p>When I moved to the Netherlands for school I had time and space to think about my upbringing. I did a lot of writing and reflecting, and I realized that my own sense of shame about the person I am is one of the lessons I learned from being an American boy. We teach our boys to feel ashamed of who they are, and this shame is part of a cultural fabric that can lead to the violence. I realized I needed to love myself and my identity, and I realized I wanted to create a space for others to do the same.</p><p>I started the <i>Cowboy Collective</i> with the hope of celebrating and loving American masculinity, and the many forms it takes. The projects are goofy and fun, but collectively they are working to promote something new, something I hope is radical.</p><p>I am <a href="https://cowboycollective.cc/cowboy/Owen%20Earl" target="_blank">by far the biggest contributor</a> to the site, but it wouldn't be serving my mission if there weren't a diversity of contributes. I am working slowing to try and build this community. It's small, but the culture is important to me, and by growing it slowly we can be more careful about making sure we building something to be proud of.<br><a href="https://cowboycollective.cc/" target="_blank">View Site&#x2192;</a></p>

    <div style="background-image: url('resource/DAA.png');" class="images"></div>
    <h2 class="overpic" id="DAA">Dancing About Architecture</h2>
    <p>Back in the aughts, the internet was a much different place then it is today. It was before social media companies like Facebook and Twitter started terraforming the web into a set of clean, manufactured, and centralized sites, that all share a kind of professional blandness, lacking in personality or identity. It was a time when the web felt more colorful and chaotic, more arts-and-crafts, more like the wild-west. </p><p>Dancing About Architecture is a website my dad made during this bygone era of the internet. It was ahead of its time, and is one of the most inspirational multimedia works of digital art. He tells the story of his life through his collection of music, and each page acts as one-part music review, one-part him telling personal anecdotes. It's non-linear, and doesn't demand you read it to completion, but the more you read the more a picture of a complete person emerges. The experience is similar to getting to know someone through casual conversations over time. I didn't myself realize that there was something deeper going on until I was around two-thirds the way through, when it hit me: this was an autobiography in disguise.</p><p>He is unashamed and fearless in his telling of his life. He talks about trauma, the time he broke into his teachers house to steal porno magazines, getting into fights with his parents, and the profound power of music.</p><p>It is a beautiful work of art, but like much of the web from that time, it went offline many years ago. I think this project deserves to be online, so I have taken it upon myself to recreate and restore it, using captures from the Internet Archive, and a draft version my dad still had a copy of. </p><p>I wanted to capture the experience someone would have had stumbling upon this site fifteen years ago, so it wasn't enough just to put it back online. I've taken the trouble of writing CSS to mimic the style of drop-down menus sites have used, and forced the site to use Times New Roman, etc. I have also painfully recreated graphics with twice the resolution and tracked down higher-resolution copies of all the album art used, so the site looks crisp on modern monitors.<br><a href="https://dance.archi/" target="_blank">View Site&#x2192;</a></p>

    <div style="background-image: url('resource/Fluxus.png');" class="images"></div>
    <h2 class="overpic" id="Fluxus">Fluxus Game for Two</h2>
    <p>There are rules to how we interact with each other everyday. Consciously or not, they dictate almost every aspect of engagement with fellow people. Sometimes these rules benefit ourselves and the people we’re engaging with. Sometimes they are to our detriment. Regardless, the rules of social interactions are something we should be aware of, and something that we should remember are malleable.</p><p>This game, inspired by the fluxus movement, reminds us to be a little more conscious and playful with the rules of social interaction.<br><a href="https://ewonrael.github.io/fluxus/index.html" target="_blank">View Site&#x2192;</a></p>
    <br><br><br>
    <div style="background-image: url('resource/Lilac.png');" class="images"></div>
    <h2 class="overpic" id="Lilac">Lilac</h2>
    <p>The experience of being in lock-down during the pandemic has been full of sorrow, but also incredible boredom. The lack of human interaction and regular schedule has lead me to start drifting off into this half dreaming place that at times felt crazy. </p><p><i>Lilac</i> is a piece that comes from this state of mind. It is the lighthearted hallucinations of an isolated person, transformed into a mini concert that can be experienced anywhere with an internet connection. <a href="https://ewonrael.github.io/Lilac/" target="_blank">View Site&#x2192;</a></p>

    <div style="background-image: url('resource/MOP.png');" class="images"></div>
    <h2 class="overpic" id="MOP">Meditations on Pornography</h2>
    <p>I became really fascinated with the fact that people were uploading pictures of themselves performing sex acts to Wikipedia. It raises some interesting questions about porn and consent and digital spaces. I wanted to explore these questions in a way that facilitates thinking, as I liked the process of questioning more then I did the actual conclusions I arrived at. I decided creating something that resembles the atmosphere of a museum would be the best way of presenting these questions, and I liked the idea of elevating what are essentially Wikipedia dick-pics into a fine-art context. Thus, <i>Meditations on Pornography</i> was born.<br><a href="https://ewonrael.github.io/mop/" target="_blank">View Site&#x2192;</a></p>
    <br><br><br>
    <div style="background-image: url('resource/Bottle.png');" class="images"></div>
    <h2 class="overpic" id="Bottle">Message in a Bottle</h2>
    <p>The idea of a message in a bottle is so simple, poetic, and sad. To receive one reminds us that there's a whole world of strangers out there with lives as rich and complex as our own, and gives us for a feeding moment a connection to one of them. The one-way nature is similar to looking at old photographs. Sending a message in a bottle gives us the opportunity to put some part of our spirit into the world and touch someone disconnected from who we are. The fact that it's a private space makes it safe to be honest about things we wouldn't be publicly. It's tantalizing. I would consider this work a digital poem, but I couldn't tell you why.<br><a href="https://ewonrael.github.io/message%20in%20a%20bottle/home.html" target="_blank">View Site&#x2192;</a></p>
    <br><br><br>
    <div style="background-image: url('resource/RedRibbon.png');" class="images"></div>
    <h2 class="overpic" id="RedRibbon">Red Ribbon</h2>
    <p><i>Red Ribbon</i> is one of my most formative experiences. It is a ballet that I wrote, directed, and produced while in High School. I decided to take this project on because of its tremendous scope. What I like about ballet is that music serves a very integral and present part of the medium, while still including many other elements. The story is a personal and universal one, of relationships and loss, and I sought out interesting things to do with the medium. I wanted to have a dance that was silent, which I hoped would be strange and eerie, and I wanted to include readings of poetry related to the story during the transitions. Not only was this an opportunity to do something big, but it was an opportunity to collaborate with others, and make art that was bigger than myself.</p><p>This was the first project I’ve ever taken on with this kind of multi-year timeline, and multi-person scale. The end result is something one would expect of a ballet put on by a group of highschoolers. Which is not to say that it is bad, but is to say that it doesn’t even come close to the perfect vision I had. The absolute best thing that came out of <i>Red Ribbon</i> for me was being in charge of a project of this scope. I honestly believe that the only way someone can get any good at this kind of large scale project is through experience and making mistakes. Red Ribbon isn’t something I expect to show off as my best work, but it will always occupy a special place in my heart for being the first.<br><a href="https://youtu.be/lRrZ1-1bD5Y" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube&#x2192;</a></p>

    <h2 class="overpic" id="TCPC">The Tin Can Phone Club</h2>
    <p>Social media sucks. It's full of advertisements and propaganda and it's constantly observing everything you do in order to create a detailed profile of the kind of person you are so it can better exploit you for profit. It's bad for your mental health, it's bad for society. It sucks.</p><p>But it does serve an important need: connection. I've noticed my family and the people I love going around social media and creating a kind of hobbled together system of group texts, group emails, and word of mouth to avoid the toxic environments. I wanted to slightly formalize this and make the process a little easier by creating my own social media platform, one that's free of spying and advertising and can change with the needs of the community.</p><p>The name <i>Tin Can Phone Club</i> was suggested by my grandmother (who uses the site!) because it's amateur and local. Just like a system of cans and strings the site can go offline randomly, but when it works it's a great alternative to Facebook and the likes. It's full of fun details, like when you get a new notification it sounds like a can being struck with a stick<br><a href="https://tincanphone.club/@owen" target="_blank">View Site&#x2192;</a></p>

    <div style="background-image: url('resource/Trickism.jpg');" class="images"></div>
    <h2 class="overpic" id="Trickism">Trickism Podcast</h2>
    <p>This is a four-part podcast/radio-show chronicling my discovery of a forgotten art movement called Tricksim. It starts with my discovery of a 1950s record titled <i>Ten Explorations in Trickism</i> by a composer named Lynda Alden. As the name of the record implies, it's a series of pieces that follow the principles of this proposed art movement. Trickism works by creating an unconscious expectation in the audience, and then subverting the expectation in a manor that forces the audience to experience a moment of self-questioning.</p><p>The podcast is a mix of conversations with my friends at art school about this record, as well as my work researching the topic of Trickism, something that proves surprisingly difficult.</p><p>The section below has plot details that might ruin the listening experience so I blacked it out, but if you click it it will become visible.</p><p id="blackout2" onclick="showme()">xx xxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxx xx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxxx xx xxxxx xx xxxxxx xxx xxxx xx xxxxxxxxxxx xx xxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxx xxxx xxxxxxx xx xx xxxx xx xxxxx xxx xxx xx xx xxxxxx xxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxx xxx xx xxxxxxxxxxx xx xxx xxxxx xx xxxxx xxx xxxx xxxx xx xxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxx xxx xxx xxxx xxxxxxxx xx xxxxx xxxxxx xxxx xxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxx xxxx xx xx xxxx xxxx xxxxxxxxxxx xxx xx xx xxxxxxx</p><p id="blackout" onclick="showme()">xxxxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xx xxxx xx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxx xxxxxxxxx xx xx xxxxx xx xxxxxxxx x xxxx xx xxxxxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxx xx xxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxx  xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxx xx x xxxx xx xxxxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxx xxxxx x xxxxx xxxx xx xxxx xxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxxx xxx xxxxxxxxx xx xxxxxxxx xxxxx xxx xx xxxxx xxxxxxxxx xx xxxxxxxx xxx xx xxx xxxx</p><p>I wanted this podcast to not just be about telling a story but also about creating an environment for the listener. I like the feeling of old mystery dramas and radio shows, and I wanted to capture it in this newer medium. I scored original music inspired by the likes of Leonard Bernstein through out the podcast, which contributes to the darker tone.</p><p>It's quite lengthy, but I would really recommend if you have the time listening to the first episode. There's a charm to it that can only be understood through experince.<br><a href="resource/Trickism1.mp3" target="_blank">Listen to First Episode&#x2192;</a></p>

    <h2 class="overpic" id="CCAM">Challenging Contemporary Art Music</h2>
    <p>I studied music composition at <i>Cornish College of the Arts</i> for two years, and before that I spent time in other music institutions like the <i><a href="https://www.colburnschool.edu/music-academy/" target="_blank">Colburn Music Academy</a></i> and the <i><a href="https://liberalarts.du.edu/lamont/summer-academy" target="_blank">Lamont School of Music's</i> precollege summer program.</a> </p><p>Because of the nature of institutionalized music education, certain aspects of music get emphasized over others. These places often have a strong focus on sheet music and ensemble performance, vertical harmony and advanced theoretical concepts like set theory. Aspects of music such as emotional resonance or listenability aren't objective or measurable and are difficult to meaningfully integrate into a institutionalized framework, and they get emphasized less.</p><p>There is a certain recognizable aesthetic that emerges from this. Music tends to be more conceptual and aesthetically challenging. This is reflected in my own work that came from these spaces. Music I wrote to tickle the ears of my peers who were also studying music.</p><p>I think this music can be hard for people outside of academic spaces to listen to, and I think having a view of music that only recognizes the validity of academic music is harmful, but I don't think academic music is bad. It's contributed a lot to our musical culture, and my personal understanding of my musical process. Many of these pieces are fun and playful, like my <i><a href="https://ewonrael.bandcamp.com/track/woodworks" target="_blank">Woodworks,</a></i> or <i><a href="https://ewonrael.bandcamp.com/track/simple-sabotage-field-manual-2" target="_blank">Simple Sabotage Field Manual,</a></i> both of which were written to accompany bizarre instruction manuals (the score for <i>Simple Sabotage Field Manual</i> is also very much worth checking out).</p><p><i>Challenging Contemporary Art Music</i> is my collection of music from and for academia. <br><a href="https://ewonrael.bandcamp.com/album/challenging-contemporary-art-music" target="_blank">Listen&#x2192;</a></p>

    <h2 class="overpic" id="HarryPotter">I'm Harry Potter (and other maximalist pieces)</h2>
    <p>Under capitalism there's this desire to make things that are going to have wide appeal, and often successful media from that past is drawn upon to try and ensure this. The people making the new media often don't understand <i>why</i> the previous thing they're drawing upon is popular, they just throw together a collection of popular images and characters and hope for the best. What's created is this bewildering collection of empty signifies and plot point. A series of representations without meaning or cohesion.</p><p>The experience of consuming this media can be dream-like. It appears as though the media has meaning, but the harder you try and grasp it the more it slips from you hands. (What do the animals in <i>Zootopia</i> represent? Is it a metaphor for racism, sexism?) The more you think about it the more confusing it becomes. It tries to be everything and ends up being nothing.</p><p>I like this dream-like aesthetic, and the music in <i>I'm Harry Potter (and other maximalist pieces)</i> reflects on this experience. They are overloaded with ideas and images that don't really add up to any specific meaning.</p><p><i><a href="https://ewonrael.bandcamp.com/track/im-harry-potter" target="_blank">I'm Harry Potter</a></i> features Harry going into the "enchanted forest," something which does not exist in the Harry Potter books. After its release the track <a href="https://twitter.com/wizrocklopedia/status/1087399653425987592" target="_blank">immediately got a shout out from the Wizrocklopedia</a> because the simple mention of Harry Potter was enough to constitute "Wiz Rock."</p><p><a href="https://ewonrael.bandcamp.com/track/fairy-tail" target="_blank"><i>Fairy Tail</i></a> also features an enchanted forest.

    <h2 class="overpic" id="onesWeLove">Ones We Love</h2>
    <p><i>Ones We Love</i> is my most recant musical project, coming out this last December. It is a true collaboration between myself and my partner Chloe Leczel. We made it as a Christmas gift for our friends and family. It is highly sentimental, featuring a mix of cover songs, and original music. <a href="https://ewonrael.bandcamp.com/track/madeleine" target="_blank"><i>Madeleine</i></a> is written for and about Chloe's friend, and <i><a href="https://ewonrael.bandcamp.com/track/cat-songs" target="_blank">Cat Songs</i></a> are a group of two duets I first learned from my grandparents (the third one Chloe and I wrote to match). It was made under a short time budget because we wanted it to be finished by Christmas, so it's less polished than some of my work.<br><a href="https://ewonrael.bandcamp.com/album/ones-we-love" target="_blank">Listen&#x2192;</a></p>

    <h2 class="overpic" id="SOTC">Songs of the Cowboy (Vol. 01)</h2>
    <p>There's a saying at the <i><a href="#cc">Cowboy Collective</i></a> which goes "anyone can be a cowboy!" One of our main missions is to facilitate and promote the creation of cowboy-themed art and media, and a great tool to do so is that of the remix. It's easier to make when you aren't starting from scratch. To better enable remixing, and foster a community-oriented approach to creation, all the art and media that exists within the collective must be licensed under the creative commons.</p><p>Cowboys are famous for "wanted" posters and cash bounties. Tapping into this cowboy spirit, the Cowboy Collective offers <a href="https://cowboycollective.cc/music" target="_blank">$1000 bounties for the creation of a music video</a>. This gives aspiring film-makers more resources to make their visions a reality, and reminds us that artists deserve to get paid for their work, even if it's public domain.</p><p>Of course you can't make a music video without a song to go along with it, so I went ahead and wrote a collection of ten cowboy songs and released them as an album, <i>Songs of the Cowboy (Vol. 01)</i>. Each song is exactly a minute long so the finished music video can go on social media platforms like TikTok or Twitter. There already exists completed music videos for all but one of this first round of ten cowboy songs, and as the "Vol. 01" in the title implies, I hope to do additional albums of ten songs with corresponding $1000 bounties.</p><p>I have, in fact, already started on the next group of songs, which you can listen to if you ask nicely. I've also made sheet music for the first round of cowboy songs.<br><a href="https://cowboycollective.bandcamp.com/album/songs-of-the-cowboy-vol-01" target="_blank">Listen&#x2192;</a></p>

    <h2 class="overpic" id="voyage">Voyage</h2>
    <p><i>Voyage</i> is an homage to the early greats of the electronic music genre, like <i>Mort Garson, Larry Fast</i>, or <i>Wendy Carlos</i>. Made using computer plugins and not analogue synths. Cheating, I'm sure. <br><a href="https://ewonrael.bandcamp.com/album/voyage-2" target="_blank">Listen&#x2192;</a></p>

    <h2 class="overpic" id="ok">we're ok</h2>
    <p>This album is very sincere in a way that I think departs from what's commonplace. The album is also incredibly sad. It is lonely, wistful, mournful. It was written during quarantine, while I was alone, and the feelings and experiences of that period in time are reflected in the album.</p><p>There's a kind of unmediated nature to the album. I am not really playing a character, I'm just singing as myself. The songs are not fantastical. Listening to the album feels a bit like you are sitting in my living room listening to me perform live for you. It was recorded in my living room, and I included background sounds from out the window to ground it in this context. I think this fits and aids thematically. </p><p>The song <a href="https://ewonrael.bandcamp.com/track/laundry-day" target="_blank"><i>Laundry Day</i></a> is about being alone in my apartment and feeling alienated and lonely which are all feelings set to the backdrop of me doing laundry.</p><p>The song <i><a href="https://ewonrael.bandcamp.com/track/first-day-of-school" target="_blank">First Day of School</i></a> is about the moment right before I attend my first day of kindergarten. It is a moment where everything in your life changes permanently. My dad says this thing about how in life sometimes you walk through doors into new rooms and the door behind you closes and locks, and you can never go back. Starting kindergarten is perhaps the first time in many of our lives that that happens, but it's hardly the last.</p><p>Obviously these are all feelings and experiences associated with the pandemic, a changing world, and changing life, isolation. But, and I think this is to the album's benefit, the pandemic is never talked about directly. The pandemic is big and intangible, and art that attempts to address it directly often falls flat. I think this is because we don't experience it directly. It's so ubiquitous that it becomes the water we are swimming in, and the actual experience of the pandemic is reflecting back on our life (like our first day of school) and feeling lonely while doing laundry.</p><p>The sadness of the album is intentional. It is very sad and does not shy away from being sad, but it's also expresses an uncomplicated kind of sadness. It is sad without being angry, without feelings of self-loathing, without doubt or fear. Just simple sadness. When I think of the media landscape I feel creators are often fearful of, or don't know how to, engage with feelings of sadness directly. They are often wrapped up in irony or anger, or they are intellectualized and problem solved. Those are all really good things to have, but if we don't also have sadness in a pure and uncomplicated form it gets unhealthy. We need to just feel simple sadness sometimes in order to process and give reverence to the sad things in life. Lord knows we have all been through some sad times, and I think having art that gives space for that in the media landscape could be needed.</p><p>There's also an optimism to it. It's called <i>we're ok</i> and I think that message is also at the album's core. As a culture we often look at sadness as a sign of brokenness, or an indication that things aren't right. I don't think this has to be the case. I think feeling sad when sad things happen is healthy. It's only a culture that doesn't permit this that's unhealthy. The album in it's own way becomes a celebration of sadness. It finds great beauty in sad things, and it's able to come to the optimistic conclusion that we're okay. We're okay, not despite our sadness, but because of it.</p><p>I think the album has strong craftsmanship. What I mean by this is that it features good technical song-writing. It can be musically complex at times, without veering into this territory of feeling jarring or difficult to listen to (with the exception of <i>Endings</i> that does that for artistic effect). The form and structure of the songs complement their lyrics which complement the music which complement the themes.</p><p>I want to highlight the song <i>First Day of School</i> because I think it serves as an example of this. As I mentioned, it's a song about this moment in life where everything changes in a permanent way. This idea is supported through the story being told in the lyrics, but also the poetic form of the lyrics. The first verse has an ABCB form with the ending words being "photograph," "control," "small," and "school." (I rhyme "control" with "school" which is not a perfect rhyme, but it's a necessary compromise.)</p><p>The second verse begins exactly the same way as the first, even ending with the same rhymes. It goes "path," "cool," and "all." Which mirrors "photograph," "control," and "small" respectively. However, instead of ending the same way as before it completely breaks form and has two more lines that rhyme with each other. So we get ABCB, ABCDD. This change in lyrical form mirrors the change in life happening in the story.</p><p><i>I am posing for a photograph,<br>standing still takes self-control,<br>my bag is big and I am feeling rather small,<br>it's my first day of school</p><p>I am walking on a shaded path,<br>the sun is warm and breeze feels cool,<br>the world is big so much I have not learned at all,<br>years have passed and in that time I've grown,<br>I think I'd rather have stayed home</i></p><p>It is also at that exact moment in the song (when I say I'd rather have stayed home) that the key changes, meaning musically we are also departing the old space and moving into a new space, like in the story. The song does something unusual formally: normally with songs we have a structure that returns to the material we hear in the beginning (like verse chorus bridge verse chorus chorus). I end with the same material I started with in all the other songs on the album, but, with <i>First Day of School</i> I never return to the musical ideas I start with. At the same moment the key changes and the lyrical form changes the song enters a B section with instrumental music, but it never goes back to the material from the beginning. </p><p>I don't think this gets in the way of the immediacy or accessibility of the song. When you listen to it for the first time it does not sound contrived, or like all of this thought is going into it. It sounds simple and sad.</p><p>If you listen closely to the album you will notice this kind of technical consideration is happening with all the songs. Hopefully this rewards repeated and thoughtful listening. </p><p>In general the album is not flashy or catchy; it's slow and contemplative. I imagine it's best understood and appreciated in a slow and contemplative way, and I hope you will give it some time.</p><p>It's by no means flawless. I haven't attempted a project quite like this before, and there's much I would change about it in retrospect, but it's imperfections fit with the tone of accepting things as they are now, even when they're less then ideal.</p><p>This is the kind of art-making I feel is most important to me.<br><a href="https://ewonrael.bandcamp.com/album/were-ok" target="_blank">Listen&#x2192;</a></p>
