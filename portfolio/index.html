    <h2>Introduction:</h2>
    <p>Hi There! </p>
    <p>There is a lot of work that I am including in my portfolio. Much of it is stuff that takes some time to appreciate: it is contemplative, or lengthy. Time is always a limited resource, and I would rather have a small selection of my work be given more of it, then a lot of my work be given little.</p>
    <p>For this reason, I just want to start off by highlighting a couple things that I think are most representative of the artist I am at this moment in time. If time constraints mean that some work has to be prioritized, this is the work I'd prefer.</p>

    <h2 class="overpic" id="Activities">Activities Index</h2>
    <p>In his 1969 Essay <i>The Activity: A New Form of Art,</i> Michael Kirby proposes a new art classification which he dubs the "Activity." Activities are a set of directions for the audience to follow, and the art exists in the performance of the directions. </p><p> I like this idea of Activity. Activities radically resist commodification, and redirect attention to the audience and away from the artist, both of which are important counterpoints to our expensive art world that celebrates individual artistic genuineness. </p><p><i>Activities Index</i> is a collection of work that I think adheres to this idea of Activity.  Michael Kirby was responding mainly to the Fluxus movement of the 60s, but this collection goes back as far as 1922 and includes work as recant as 2018. It includes work by composers, religious philosophers, painters, and friends of mine. Hopefully it encourages you to rethink art, and maybe even perform some Activities yourself!<br><a href="https://activities-index.github.io/" target="_blank">View Site&#x2192;</a></p>

    <div style="background-image: url('resource/CowboyCollective.png');" class="images"></div>
    <h2 class="overpic" id="CowboyCollective">The Cowboy Collective</h2>
    <p><i>The Cowboy Collective</i> is a space to celebrate and create cowboy themed art and media. The work can be fun, thoughtful, ironic, sentimental, irreverent, academic, sometimes all these things at once. The site includes essays about <a href="https://cowboycollective.cc/cowboy/Mary%20Poppins" target="_blank">why Marry Poppins is a cowboy</a>, or <a href="https://cowboycollective.cc/2020/09/05/CowboyEssay.html" target="_blank">examining the changing image and memory of the cowboy</a>. It includes an <a href="https://cowboycollective.cc/2021/02/20/Pistol-Pete.html" target="_blank">unaired television pilot</a>, a <a href="https://cowboycollective.cc/2020/10/16/CaterpillarCowboy.html" target="_blank">caterpillar themed video game</a>, a <a href="https://cowboycollective.cc/2020/04/13/AILit.html" target="_blank">crude AI that generate cowboy literature</a>, and the <a href="https://cowboycollective.cc/2020/09/25/CowChildren.html" target="_blank">surreal, nightmarish podcast Cow Children</a>. The site encourages you to make by providing resources like <a href="https://cowboycollective.cc/2019/11/30/CowboyFonts.html" target="_blank">fonts</a>, <a href="https://cowboycollective.cc/2019/12/01/WANTEDPosters.html" target="_blank">wanted poster templates</a>, a <a href="https://cowboycollective.cc/2019/12/03/03CowboyhatPack.html" target="_blank">pre-photoshopped cowboy hat pack</a>, and most importantly, a <a href="https://cowboycollective.cc/music" target="_blank">$1000 (yes real money) reward for making a minute-long music video</a>.</p><p>The collective is colorful, eclectic, weird, and engaging, and you would be forgiven for missing the underlying political aims of the site. But the Cowboy Collective has a goal: <a href="https://cowboycollective.cc/2019/11/28/Manifesto.html" target="_blank">saving American masculinity.</a></p><p>I'm an American boy, and growing up in a country where almost two mass shootings occur a day (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mass_shootings_in_the_United_States_in_2020" target="_blank">even during a pandemic</a>) is scary and alienating. I never felt connected to my country's culture, especially what it has to say about being a man, and while living there I started to detest my own identity. I wished to amputate the American man in me and throw it away.</p><p>When I moved to the Netherlands for school I had time and space to think about my upbringing. I did a lot of writing and reflecting, and I realized that my own sense of shame about the person I am is one of the lessons I learned from being an American boy. We teach our boys to feel ashamed of who they are, and this shame is part of a cultural fabric that can lead to the violence. I realized I needed to love myself and my identity, and I realized I wanted to create a space for others to do the same.</p><p>I started the <i>Cowboy Collective</i> with the hope of celebrating and loving American masculinity, and the many forms it takes. The projects are goofy and fun, but collectively they are working to promote something new, something I hope is radical.</p><p>I am <a href="https://cowboycollective.cc/cowboy/Owen%20Earl" target="_blank">by far the biggest contributor</a> to the site, but it wouldn't be serving my mission if there weren't a diversity of contributes. I am working slowing to try and build this community. It's small, but the culture is important to me, and by growing it slowly we can be more careful about making sure we building something to be proud of.<br><a href="https://cowboycollective.cc/" target="_blank">View Site&#x2192;</a></p>

    <h2 class="overpic" id="DAA">Dancing About Architecture</h2>
    <p>Back in the aughts, the internet was a much different place then it is today. It was before social media companies like Facebook and Twitter started terraforming the web into a set of clean, manufactured, and centralized sites, that all share a kind of professional blandness, lacking in personality or identity. It was a time when the web felt more colorful and chaotic, more arts-and-crafts, more like the wild-west. </p><p>Dancing About Architecture is a website my dad made during this bygone era of the internet. It was ahead of its time, and is one of the most inspirational multimedia works of digital art. He tells the story of his life through his collection of music, and each page acts as one-part music review, one-part him telling personal anecdotes. It's non-linear, and doesn't demand you read it to completion, but the more you read the more a picture of a complete person emerges. The experience is similar to getting to know someone through casual conversations over time. I didn't myself realize that there was something deeper going on until I was around two-thirds the way through, when it hit me: this was an autobiography in disguise.</p><p>He is unashamed and fearless in his telling of his life. He talks about trauma, the time he broke into his teachers house to steal porno magazines, getting into fights with his parents, and the profound power of music.</p><p>It is a beautiful work of art, but like much of the web from that time, it went offline many years ago. I think this project deserves to be online, so I have taken it upon myself to recreate and restore it, using captures from the Internet Archive, and a draft version my dad still had a copy of. </p><p>I wanted to capture the experience someone would have had stumbling upon this site fifteen years ago, so it wasn't enough just to put it back online. I've taken the trouble of writing CSS to mimic the style of drop-down menus sites have used, and forced the site to use Times New Roman, etc. I have also painfully recreated graphics with twice the resolution and tracked down higher-resolution copies of all the album art used, so the site looks crisp on modern monitors.<br><a href="https://dance.archi/" target="_blank">View Site&#x2192;</a></p>

    <div style="background-image: url('resource/Fluxus.png');" class="images"></div>
    <h2 class="overpic" id="Fluxus">Fluxus Game for Two</h2>
    <p>There are rules to how we interact with each other everyday. Consciously or not, they dictate almost every aspect of engagement with fellow people. Sometimes these rules benefit ourselves and the people we’re engaging with. Sometimes they are to our detriment. Regardless, the rules of social interactions are something we should be aware of, and something that we should remember are malleable.</p><p>This game, inspired by the fluxus movement, reminds us to be a little more conscious and playful with the rules of social interaction.<br><a href="https://ewonrael.github.io/fluxus/index.html" target="_blank">View Site&#x2192;</a></p>
    <br><br><br>
    <div style="background-image: url('resource/Lilac.png');" class="images"></div>
    <h2 class="overpic" id="Lilac">Lilac</h2>
    <p>The experience of being in lock-down during the pandemic has been full of sorrow, but also incredible boredom. The lack of human interaction and regular schedule has lead me to start drifting off into this half dreaming place that at times felt crazy. </p><p><i>Lilac</i> is a piece that comes from this state of mind. It is the lighthearted hallucinations of an isolated person, transformed into a mini concert that can be experienced anywhere with an internet connection. <a href="https://ewonrael.github.io/Lilac/" target="_blank">View Site&#x2192;</a></p>

    <div style="background-image: url('resource/MOP.png');" class="images"></div>
    <h2 class="overpic" id="MOP">Meditations on Pornography</h2>
    <p>I became really fascinated with the fact that people were uploading pictures of themselves performing sex acts to Wikipedia. It raises some interesting questions about porn and consent and digital spaces. I wanted to explore these questions in a way that facilitates thinking, as I liked the process of questioning more then I did the actual conclusions I arrived at. I decided creating something that resembles the atmosphere of a museum would be the best way of presenting these questions, and I liked the idea of elevating what are essentially Wikipedia dick-pics into a fine-art context. Thus, <i>Meditations on Pornography</i> was born.<br><a href="https://ewonrael.github.io/mop/" target="_blank">View Site&#x2192;</a></p>
    <br><br><br>
    <div style="background-image: url('resource/Bottle.png');" class="images"></div>
    <h2 class="overpic" id="Bottle">Message in a Bottle</h2>
    <p>The idea of a message in a bottle is so simple, poetic, and sad. To receive one reminds us that there's a whole world of strangers out there with lives as rich and complex as our own, and gives us for a feeding moment a connection to one of them. The one-way nature is similar to looking at old photographs. Sending a message in a bottle gives us the opportunity to put some part of our spirit into the world and touch someone disconnected from who we are. The fact that it's a private space makes it safe to be honest about things we wouldn't be publicly. It's tantalizing. I would consider this work a digital poem, but I couldn't tell you why.<br><a href="https://ewonrael.github.io/message%20in%20a%20bottle/home.html" target="_blank">View Site&#x2192;</a></p>
    <br><br><br>
    <div style="background-image: url('resource/RedRibbon.png');" class="images"></div>
    <h2 class="overpic" id="RedRibbon">Red Ribbon</h2>
    <p><i>Red Ribbon</i> is one of my most formative experiences. It is a ballet that I wrote, directed, and produced while in High School. I decided to take this project on because of its tremendous scope. What I like about ballet is that music serves a very integral and present part of the medium, while still including many other elements. The story is a personal and universal one, of relationships and loss, and I sought out interesting things to do with the medium. I wanted to have a dance that was silent, which I hoped would be strange and eerie, and I wanted to include readings of poetry related to the story during the transitions. Not only was this an opportunity to do something big, but it was an opportunity to collaborate with others, and make art that was bigger than myself.</p><p>This was the first project I’ve ever taken on with this kind of multi-year timeline, and multi-person scale. The end result is something one would expect of a ballet put on by a group of highschoolers. Which is not to say that it is bad, but is to say that it doesn’t even come close to the perfect vision I had. The absolute best thing that came out of <i>Red Ribbon</i> for me was being in charge of a project of this scope. I honestly believe that the only way someone can get any good at this kind of large scale project is through experience and making mistakes. Red Ribbon isn’t something I expect to show off as my best work, but it will always occupy a special place in my heart for being the first.<br><a href="https://youtu.be/lRrZ1-1bD5Y" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube&#x2192;</a></p>

    <h2 class="overpic" id="TCPC">The Tin Can Phone Club</h2>
    <p>Social media sucks. It's full of advertisements and propaganda and it's constantly observing everything you do in order to create a detailed profile of the kind of person you are so it can better exploit you for profit. It's bad for your mental health, it's bad for society. It sucks.</p><p>But it does serve an important need: connection. I've noticed my family and the people I love going around social media and creating a kind of hobbled together system of group texts, group emails, and word of mouth to avoid the toxic environments. I wanted to slightly formalize this and make the process a little easier by creating my own social media platform, one that's free of spying and advertising and can change with the needs of the community.</p><p>The name <i>Tin Can Phone Club</i> was suggested by my grandmother (who uses the site!) because it's amateur and local. Just like a system of cans and strings the site can go offline randomly, but when it works it's a great alternative to Facebook and the likes. It's full of fun details, like when you get a new notification it sounds like a can being struck with a stick<br><a href="https://tincanphone.club/@owen" target="_blank">View Site&#x2192;</a></p>

    <div style="background-image: url('resource/Trickism.jpg');" class="images"></div>
    <h2 class="overpic" id="Trickism">Trickism Podcast</h2>
    <p>This is a four-part podcast/radio-show chronicling my discovery of a forgotten art movement called Tricksim. It starts with my discovery of a 1950s record titled <i>Ten Explorations in Trickism</i> by a composer named Lynda Alden. As the name of the record implies, it's a series of pieces that follow the principles of this proposed art movement. Trickism works by creating an unconscious expectation in the audience, and then subverting the expectation in a manor that forces the audience to experience a moment of self-questioning.</p><p>The podcast is a mix of conversations with my friends at art school about this record, as well as my work researching the topic of Trickism, something that proves surprisingly difficult.</p><p>The section below has plot details that might ruin the listening experience so I blacked it out, but if you click it it will become visible.</p><p id="blackout2" onclick="showme()">As the podcast develops things start to become stranger and stranger. It seems as though the lack of information on this art movement isn't just because it is lost to time, but due to an active conspiracy involving the US Government. No one wants to talk, and when they do their stories don't add up. What happened to Lynda Alden? What does her untimely death have to do with this conspiracy? Are we in danger?</p><p id="blackout" onclick="showme()">Eventually things escalate so much is becomes obvious that the podcast, which purported to be true, is actually a work of fiction. There never was an art movement called "Trickism."  Lynda Alden never existed. It, itself is a work of Trickism. The podcast spends a great deal of time explaining exactly how it's own mechanisms of trickery work, and it still succeeds in tricking you in the end.</p><p>I wanted this podcast to not just be about telling a story but also about creating an environment for the listener. I like the feeling of old mystery dramas and radio shows, and I wanted to capture it in this newer medium. I scored original music inspired by the likes of Leonard Bernstein through out the podcast, which contributes to the darker tone.</p><p>It's quite lengthy, but I would really recommend if you have the time listening to the first episode. There's a charm to it that can only be understood through experince.<br><a href="resource/Trickism1.mp3" target="_blank">Listen to First Episode&#x2192;</a></p>
