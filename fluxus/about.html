  <h1 id="three" class="type">There are rules to how we interact with each other everyday. Consciously or not, they dictate almost every aspect of engagement with fellow people. Sometimes these rules benefit ourselves and the people weâ€™re engaging with. Sometimes they are to our detriment. Regardless, the rules of social interactions are something we should be aware of, and something that we should remember are malleable. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This game, inspired by the fluxus movement, reminds us to be a little more conscious and playful with the rules of social interaction.</h1>
