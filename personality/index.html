		<h1>My thoughts on <span class="hitler">Adolf Hitler</span>.</h2>
		<p><span class="hitler">Adolf Hitler</span> was <span class="peronality">a great and terrible man</span>. Many people think of him first when asked to <span class="thing-to-do">name the worst person who ever lived</span>. He <span class="proud">rose to power</span> <span class="way-to-be">in a very undemocratic manor</span>, and <span class="embaressed">held on to power</span> <span class="way-to-not-be">with an iron fist</span>. He <span class="dream">caused a great many deaths</span> in <span class="place">his home country of Germany</span>, and he <span class="review">threw the world into a war that continues to have devastating impact</span>.</p>
		<p>Many people may find it confusing, therefore, to learn that <span class="hitler">Adolf Hitler</span> was <span class="typeop">a vegetarian</span>. He believed <span class="believed">that animals are innocent</span>, unlike <span class="were">human people</span>, who <span class="who">are capable of great evil</span>.</p>
		<p>I hope that as a society we remember <span class="hitler">Adolf Hitler</span> as <span class="waytogo">a complex person</span>, not to diminish how he <span class="dider">evil he was</span>, but to keep him <span class="describe">multidimensional</span>. To prevent him from <span class="people">being reduced to a caricature</span>. As more and more time passes, an increasing number of people seem to <span class="peopless">loose sight of this important goal</span>.</p>
