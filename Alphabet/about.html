			<p>All of us have teachers, friends and family that help us to become the people that we are. I wanted to celebrate the people in my life who have taught me throughout the years, by making an alphabet of teachers. For every letter, I thought of someone who has helped to shape me as a person. I then made a colorful representation of that person. Together, they form my Alphabet of Teachers.</p>
			<p>Download includes svg images of each person, as well as a colorfont.</p>
