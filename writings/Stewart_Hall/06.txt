CHAPTER 06 Conclusion: Representation, meaning and Language Reconsidered

This is a brief summery of the book. First we learned the constructionist approach to representation, which states that structures of signifiers and their relationship to each other within a structure is what gives things interpretable meaning. This accounts for differences between cultures and different time periods.

We then took this idea of how meaning is created and applied it to broader contexts, such as cultural objects like clothing. This system of understanding meaning can be applied to broader and broader contexts, creating large, overarching narratives that are more interpretive. 

Once you are inspecting these larger systems of meaning there are different theories you can use to analyze objects. There's the more semiotic approach put forward by Barthes, and the discursive approach put forward by Foucault.
